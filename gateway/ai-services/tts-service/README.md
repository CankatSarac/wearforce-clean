```

## Streaming TTS

Enable real-time audio streaming for long texts:

```python
import httpx

async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
    async with client.stream(
        "POST",
        "http://localhost:8002/synthesize-stream",
        json={
            "text": "Long text to stream...",
            "voice": "en_US-lessac-high",
            "enable_streaming": True
        }
    ) as response:
        async for chunk in response.aiter_bytes():
            # Process audio chunk
            process_audio_chunk(chunk)
```

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Test all endpoints
python test_tts.py

# Test with custom text
python test_tts.py --text "Custom text to synthesize"

# Test against different host/port
python test_tts.py --host production.example.com --port 8002
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite validates:
- ✅ Health check endpoint
- ✅ Service information
- ✅ Voice listing and statistics
- ✅ System validation
- ✅ English TTS synthesis
- ✅ Turkish TTS synthesis
- ✅ Audio format handling
- ✅ Error handling

## Performance

### Optimization Features

- **Concurrent Synthesis**: Limited concurrent requests to prevent overload
- **Redis Caching**: Cache synthesized audio for repeated requests
- **Streaming**: Real-time audio streaming for long texts
- **Audio Compression**: Multiple format support (WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC)
- **Model Validation**: Prevalidate voice models and Piper installation

### Performance Metrics

- Typical synthesis time: 0.1-0.5s per sentence
- Memory usage: ~500MB with loaded models
- Concurrent requests: Up to 4 simultaneous synthesis operations
- Cache hit rate: ~60-80% for repeated content

## Monitoring

### Health Checks

```bash
# Basic health check
curl http://localhost:8002/health

# Comprehensive system validation
curl http://localhost:8002/system/validation

# Performance statistics
curl http://localhost:8002/system/stats
```

### Prometheus Metrics

Available at `/metrics` endpoint:
- Request count and latency
- Synthesis operations
- Cache hit/miss rates
- Voice model usage
- Error rates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Piper not found**
   - Ensure Piper TTS is installed and in PATH
   - Check Docker image includes Piper installation

2. **Voice models missing**
   - Download voice models to the correct directory
   - Use the voice download endpoint or manual installation

3. **Audio quality issues**
   - Try different voice models (high vs medium quality)
   - Adjust sample rate and format settings
   - Check input text preprocessing

4. **Performance issues**
   - Enable Redis caching
   - Limit concurrent synthesis requests
   - Use appropriate voice quality for use case

### Logs and Debugging

```bash
# View service logs
docker-compose logs tts-service

# Enable debug logging
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Test Piper installation
piper --version

# Validate voice models
ls -la models/piper/*/
```

## Architecture

### Components

- **FastAPI Application**: HTTP API server
- **Piper Engine**: TTS synthesis engine wrapper
- **Voice Manager**: Voice model management and caching
- **Redis Cache**: Response caching layer
- **Health Checker**: System monitoring and validation

### Data Flow

1. HTTP request → FastAPI endpoint
2. Text preprocessing and validation
3. Voice model selection and loading
4. Piper TTS synthesis
5. Audio post-processing (effects, format conversion)
6. Response caching (if enabled)
7. HTTP response with audio data
